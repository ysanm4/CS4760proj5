This is the README for project 3 made by Yosef Alqufidi

How to run this project:

To run this project you will first need to compile oss.cpp and worker.cpp in this file. The two files that exist are a c++ worker file and a c++ oss file.

Step 1, Compile: In the command line type "make" which will compile both the user and the oss file.

Step 2, Running the files: After you compile with make, run ./oss -h to display the help menu.

Step 3, Running oss file with other parameters: Now you can try running oss like this. ./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 2 -i 100 -f logfile.txt.

Step 4, Checking logfile: Make sure to open logfile to check its contents.

Do not run ./oss -n 1 -s 1 without including -t, -i, and -f or ./oss -n 1 by itself because nothing will end up happening and you will get an error message telling you that, you will need to run all 3 together. You will need to give all inputs!
